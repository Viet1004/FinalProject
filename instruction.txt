firsy just run the makefile and then:

first we need to encode a message and here this message is 0 1 2 3 and is fixed in the runnerencode.c, you can change it for test => run runnerencode
the result of encoding would be visible in message.txt

then it's time to decode what is in the message.txt and for this we run runner'
the result is visible in decoded.txt
